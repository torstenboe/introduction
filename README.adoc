== ocloud Framework

image:https://img.shields.io/badge/license-UPL-green[link="LICENSE"]

In recent years cloud infrastructure has become a very popular alternative to traditional data center. An increasing number of enterprise IT departments outsource their infrastructure operation to a cloud provider. Relying on a service delivery framework helps application manager keep their services aligned with the needs of the business, even when the infrastructure is operated by a third party. Usually, business value is measured in reduced cost, decreased time-to-market or increased revenue. Cloud infrastructure platfroms increase operational efficiency, acclerate the development process for new services and avoids investment risks. Infrastructure pools provide resources on-deamnd. But while launching a cloud server has become a matter of pressing a button, building a hosting platform for intra- and extranet services remains challenging. Operators need to comply with security and compliance guidlines before provisioning their first server. This framework expedites this process. Operators start with default configuration and refine their platform in small incremental steps. link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code["Infrastructure as Code" (IaC)] is employed to extract configuration parameters from service assets and to inherit operator controls during the provisioning process. link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/resourcemanager.htm[Oracle's Resource Manager (ORM)] is used to generate graphical user interfaces and REST-API from code variables automatically. This enables operations engineers to build templates that trigger provisioning processes for new resources with a service deployment. Service manager benefit from on-demand infrastructure, operators remain in control and effectuate security and comliance guidlines. 

=== Architecture
The ocloud framework supports the adoption of link:https://www.oracle.com/cloud/[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)] with a baseline configuration for service deployments. Rather than separating service design and infrastructure automation, service configurations include provisioning instructions for service assets. The framework defines a link:assets/resident[service resident] isolating service assets in a network segment and creates administrator domains to reflect operational responsibilities. An administrator domain combines OCI resources like compartments, groups, policies, identity tags and notifications into a reusable asset that separates system operators from network-, database-, and security operators.

.Baseline Configuration 
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocilabs/images/main/base_config.drawio.png[Baseline Configuration]

A segment represents various network ressources in OCI. It combines a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) with a dynamic routing gateway (DRG), a service gateway for the Oracle Service Network, an internet- and a NAT gateway. It contains an adjustable number of subnets, defined using Terraform's  link:https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/cidrsubnet[cidrsubnet()] function and secures IP spaces through firewalls. A firewall represents port filter, implemented using security lists. In the default configuration egress traffic is unconstrained, ingress traffic is limited to a minimum set of application profiles and will need adjustments, launching a service. Routing destinations trigger the definition of route rules. The DRG is obligatory and proiveds on-prem connectivity as an edge router. Adding network segments, additional routers can be defined and associated with VCN, naming both equally. Internet and NAT gateways are activated per default, but can be deactivated in the resource manager interface. 

=== Recommendations
Provisioning templates extract configuration parameter from the deployment code. This enables operators to start with a recommendet set of resources and refine the configuration in incremental steps. The state-aware provisioning process suggests an iterative approach, applying the SCRUM method. A team is made up of system administrators with expertise in application management, network-, database- and security operations. Operators can adjust settings without learning HCL or Terraform. Network and security settings are captured in JSON files, stored in an own directory to be edited without touching the deployment code.

[#img-architecture] 
.Code Delivery
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocilabs/images/main/code_delivery.drawio.png[Code Delivery]

The framework aims to provide more flexibility for infrastructure operators. Storing the code in a git repository and connecting the Resource Manager (ORM) with the code source allows administrators to adopt a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery[continuous delivery] process for cloud resources. Engineers "borrow" tools and workflows invented for software developer. But, instead of using these for application code, operators leverage them for infrastructure automation. Git becomes the single source of truth for both, deployment- and provisioning instructions. A service template describes the desired state for the assets of a resident in a declarative format so that it can be versioned inside the repository. Entry barriers for a self-service oriented operation are lowered in three steps: 

- *Cloud Discovery*: Initial deployment with default settings offers a foundation for a first service deployment. Operators evaluate the various configuration options, OCI has to offer, with a real implementation. This enables engineers to introduce OCI to system administrators and service owners and discover services that help to bootstrap service operation tasks. 
- *Architecture Refinement*: Configuration parameters are stored as lists of objects in JSON format. Dependencies are modelled using names. Subject matter experts refine parameter by either add, change or delete objects. The number of arguments has been bootstrapped from the original resource descriptions. Combining mulitple resources into assets allows reduce the arguments significantly and use a terminology that system administrators are familar with.
- *Service Composition*: The objective of every adoption project is the definition of a service. Beside refining the topology, servers need to be configured and application installed. Bash scripts can be added to a host configuration or predefined services can be attached to a resident. An attachement module allows to attaching services from the Oracle Service Network, building individual services requires service modules that are either provieded as blueprints or can be defined by operations engineers.


=== Considerations
link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/resourcemanager.htm[Oracle's Resource Manager (ORM)] exposes assets through proteced user- and application interfaces, keeping service owners in charge to determine when and where a service will be launched. A schema file extends the console and facilitates variable entries in the `Create Stack` page. The default schema offers the following of options:

* *Tenancy Classification*: The class parameter helps to constraint resource deployments according to the service limits associated with contract for a tenancy. 

* *Resident Configuration*: In the second section meta data assciated with a resident is collected. Names should be unique for a tenancy to avoid conflicts for resources, defined on root level. The lifecycle stage helps engineers to avoid over provisioning of resources that take a long time to be destroyed.

* *Topology Options*: Executing the default deployment plan, the resource manager offers a choice of topologies that enable common use cases like enterprise applications, big-data and cloud-native services. These options can also be combined to build hybrid services. The opology selection triggers the subnet topology for a segment.

* *Network Settings*: Generic network parameter trigger the level of exposure to the public internet. Activating the internet gateway will expose a frontend, and/or load balancer network to the public internet.   

* *Domain Protection*: The default protection setting is triggered by the lifecycle setting, however can be changed should that be required.

==== Create company specifc service assets
Service configuration represents a next level of customization. JSON files represent the design, scale and scope of a service. In the refinement phase teams collect input from practitioners to adjust the default parameter that allow operators to controll demand and optimize capacity utilization.

==== Compose cloud solutions with service assets
*Service Assets* abstract provider specific APIs and contain code that can refer to multiple resource provider in order to merge resources from multiple provider into logical, customer specific resource interfaces. The resources manager comes with a number of link:https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Concepts/providers.htm[service provider] preinstalled, additional can be pulled form the link:https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers[Terraform registry], using the link:https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/providers/configuration.html[provider block]. Components reflect best practices, collected throughout numerous projects and remain subject to change. Initially we provide the following modules:

* Service Attachments - The Oracle Service Network offers a variety of public cloud services that can be attached to a private service through a service gateway.
* Service Assets - Terraform modules represent service assets. Predefined modules can be invoked referring to OCI modules in the link:https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules?provider=oci[terraform registry] or to a git repository, containing infrastructure code. A great starting point with limited coding requirements are the link:https://registry.terraform.io/search/modules?q=oci%20cloud%20bricks[cloudbricks] components. 
* Service Modules - ORM Stacks 

=== Deployment
The configuration module translates generic input paramerts into a baseline configuration for OCI resources. Extracting the service configuration from the automation scripts enables an iterative service development process, enabling engineers to work on smaller increments and refine the settings towards the completion of the template. Each increment can be discussed with subject matter experts like application manager, database-, network- or security operators. Applying default settings for increments, enables system administrators to use preliminary deployments and evaluate service designs before putting them into production. Using the resource manager operators can rely on state-aware increments that enable engineers to adjust topologies when requirements evolve. For one-time deployments, the link:https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?zipUrl=https://github.com/oracle-devrel/terraform-oci-ocloud-landing-zone/archive/refs/heads/main.zip[Deploy to the Oracle Cloud] button creates a zip archive that is pushed to the resource manager directly, to enable continuous changes the code should be cloned into a private repository and be connected as a source provider.

An optional operator node is employed to execute cron jobs and runbooks that help to manage service availability, schedule resource consumption and fix problems for container workloads and functions. In addition service configurations enable service manager to adopt Oracle Cloud Services as alternative to shared intranet services and to benefit from link:https://github.com/oracle-quickstart[blueprints] for services like utility computing, web- and mobile backbone services.

==== Resource Interfaces

Modules deploy a variety of different resources, like infrastructure components, predefined cloud services, applications or third party software products. Usually we employ the terraform service provider to provision resources, however, command line scripts, API or SDK are additional options.

==== Prerequisites
Code is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), includes data stored in JSON format and cloud init scripts. We use the OCI Resource Manager service to install, configure, and manage Terraform code in order to support a fast adoption of the "infrastructure-as-code" model.

The landing zone is meant to provision resources in an isolated compartment. The naming should be unique though, because some resources, like tag namepaces and policy groups are defined on root level. While compartment names are constructed to avoid overlaps, name conflicts are avoided referring to a tenancy specific link:doc/naming.adoc[naming convention].

=== Notes/Issues
* It is recommended to run the first "terraform apply" without bastion session enabled. Enabling the bastion session in the first run will produce an error message. Run the "apply" a second time resolves the issue. 
* The resource manager is using some terms internally, these need to be avoided defining a stack. examples are "user" or "domain".
* Destroying compartments and tag namespaces should be an exception and can take a long time. Best practice is destroying all other resources using a reduce apply scope, before destroying the compartments with a destroy command. In the default setup, the "enable_delete" flag prevents un-intensional destroy of compartments. 
* The stack deploys multiple tag namespaces that can only be destroyed one by one. Hence, running destroy for the first and second time will fail and the process has to be repeated at least twice.
