The continous architecture principles help cloud engineers to develop a secure , resilient infrastructure for cloud services that is operated efficiently. Working in the incremental and evolving way that supports Agile and DevOps methods improves the qulaity and reduces the cost of a service design.

* *Architect products* stands for evolve from designing cloud solutions to developing service assets. Architecting reusable assets is more efficient than designing blueprints for a specific solution and focusses teams on business value rather than applying generic cloud capabilites.
* *Focus on quality attributes, not on functional requirements* Quality attribute requirements drive the architecture.
* *Delay design decisions until they are absolutely necessary* Design architectures based on facts, not on guesses. There is no point in designing and implementing capabilities that may never be used—it is a waste of time and resources.
* *Architect for change* Leverage the “power of small.” Big, monolithic, tightly coupled components are hard to change. Instead, leverage small, loosely coupled software elements.
* *PArchitect for build, test, deploy, and operate* Most architecture methodologies focus exclusively on software building activities, but we believe that architects should be concerned about testing, deployment, and operation, too, in order to support continuous delivery.
* *Model the organization of your teams after the design of the system you are working on* The way teams are organized drives the architecture and design of the systems they are working on.
