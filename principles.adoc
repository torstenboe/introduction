The continous architecture principles help cloud engineers to develop a secure , resilient infrastructure for cloud services that is operated efficiently. Working in the incremental and evolving way that supports Agile and DevOps methods improves the quality of a service design.

* *Architect assets* suggests to evolve from addressing project requirements with bespoke solutions to developing services with reusable assets. Architecting service assets is more efficient than designing lueprints for cloud services and focusses teams on business value rather than generic platform capabilites.
* *Focus on quality attributes, not on functional requirements* Like in application software engineering "quality attribute" requirements should drive the architecture. The definition of infrastructure attributes is driven by the system requirements and defined by the application that is about to be hosted on OCI.
* *Delay design decisions until they are absolutely necessary* Design architectures based on facts, not on guesses. There is no point in designing and implementing capabilities that may never be used—it is a waste of time and resources.
* *Architect for change* Leverage the “power of small.” Big, monolithic, tightly coupled components are hard to change. Instead, leverage small, loosely coupled software elements.
* *PArchitect for build, test, deploy, and operate* Most architecture methodologies focus exclusively on software building activities, but we believe that architects should be concerned about testing, deployment, and operation, too, in order to support continuous delivery.
* *Model the organization of your teams after the design of the system you are working on* The way teams are organized drives the architecture and design of the systems they are working on.
