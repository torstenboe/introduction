Continous architecture principles help operation engineers to develop a secure, resilient delivery platform for enterprise cloud services that is operated efficiently. Working in incremental, evolving steps towards a service design supports agile and DevOps methods that improve the quality and keep cost and complexity under control.

* *Architect services, not solutions* A service delivers business value by facilitating the desired outcome without transfering the ownership for operational costs and risks to the user. Initially services are assembled using monitored and managed infrastructure components with PaaS and SaaS attachments. When functional requirements evolve, operators consider self-managed modules as replacement for public cloud services.

* *Innovate without disruption* Operational models for IT departments have incorporate shared infrastructure services in some shape or form. Operational responsibilities for database or network infrastructure is reflected in a separation of duties. Cloud services are usually designed as blueprints that represent the entire footprint in a single automation script. Extracting configuration parameters from the deployment code, the framework provides an automated provisioning process that collects input from existing competence center.

* *Build a delivery platform for services* The foundation of a service is assembled with reusable assets. This ensures compliance and security with a high level of flexibility. The build once, use often method is reflected in asset libraries that can be invoked in a modular fashion. 

* *Leverage network segmentation for hybrid services* Designing a service, architects focus on system requirements, communication pattern and orchestration capabilities before considering functional requirements. This turns the usual design process upside down and requires to focus on a minimum set of attribtues first.

* *Delay design decisions until they are absolutely necessary* Platforms evolve, there is no point in designing and implementing capabilities that may never be used—it is a waste of time and resources.
* *Architect for change* Context will change. Leverage the “power of small.” Big, monolithic, tightly coupled components are hard to change. Instead, leverage small, loosely coupled software elements.
* *PArchitect for build, test, deploy, and operate* Most architecture methodologies focus exclusively on software building activities, but we believe that architects should be concerned about testing, deployment, and operation, too, in order to support continuous delivery.
* *Model the organization of your teams after the design of the system you are working on* The way teams are organized drives the architecture and design of the systems they are working on.
* *Start Small* also from team size
