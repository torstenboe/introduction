Continous architecture principles help operation engineers to develop a secure, resilient delivery platform for enterprise cloud services that is operated efficiently. Working in incremental, evolving steps towards a service design supports agile and DevOps methods that improve the quality and keep cost and complexity under control.

* *Architect services, not solutions* A service delivers business value by facilitating the desired outcome without transfering the ownership for operational costs and risks to the user. Initially services are assembled using monitored and managed infrastructure components with PaaS and SaaS attachments. When functional requirements evolve, operators consider self-managed modules as replacement for public cloud services.

* *Innovate without disruption* Cloud services are usually designed as blueprints that represent the entire footprint in a single automation script. Operational models for IT departments have incorporate shared infrastructure services in some shape or form. Operational responsibilities for database or network infrastructure is reflected in a separation of duties. Extracting configuration parameters from the deployment code, the framework provides an automated provisioning process that collects input from existing competence center.

* *Build services with a common foundation* Modern CI/CD are usually developed around highly abstracted infrastrucure components. Optimizing cost for dedicated infrastrucure would require tobuild a platform before supporting an on-demand model. With this framework, provisioning scripts for service assets ensure secure and compliant application deployments without prebuild resources. IaC libraries can be invoked to launch resources together with a deployment script. 

* *Leverage network segmentation for hybrid services* High level terms, like "cloud native" or "enterprise applications" often describe the fact that application  attributes Designing a service, architects focus on system requirements, communication pattern and orchestration capabilities before considering functional requirements. This turns the usual design process upside down and requires to focus on a minimum set of attribtues first.

* *Delay design decisions until they are absolutely necessary* Platforms evolve, there is no point in designing and implementing capabilities that may never be used—it is a waste of time and resources.
* *Architect for change* Context will change. Leverage the “power of small.” Big, monolithic, tightly coupled components are hard to change. Instead, leverage small, loosely coupled software elements.
* *PArchitect for build, test, deploy, and operate* Most architecture methodologies focus exclusively on software building activities, but we believe that architects should be concerned about testing, deployment, and operation, too, in order to support continuous delivery.
* *Model the organization of your teams after the design of the system you are working on* The way teams are organized drives the architecture and design of the systems they are working on.
* *Start Small* also from team size
