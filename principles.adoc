Continous architecture principles help operation engineers to develop a secure, resilient delivery platform for enterprise cloud services that is operated efficiently. Working in incremental, evolving steps towards a service design supports agile and DevOps methods that improve the quality and keep cost and complexity under control.

* *Architect services, not solutions* A service delivers business value by facilitating the desired outcome without transfering the ownership for operational costs and risks to the user. Initially services are assembled using monitored and managed infrastructure components with PaaS and SaaS attachments. When functional requirements evolve, operators consider self-managed modules as replacement for public cloud services.

* *Facilitate context-aware deployments* The way teams are organized drives the architecture and design of the systems they are working on. The commercial and the operational context for a service changes over time. Leveraging the “power of small” allows to move fast. In order to support a continuous delivery, tenancies are classified commercially and the lifecycle status is captured in the service configuration.

* *Innovate without disruption* Cloud services are usually designed as blueprints that represent the entire footprint in a single automation script. Operational models for IT departments have incorporated shared infrastructure services in some shape or form. E.g. operational responsibilities for database or network infrastructure is reflected in a separation of duties. Extracting configuration parameters from the deployment code, the framework provides an automated provisioning process that collects input from existing competence center.

* *Build services on a common foundation* Platforms evolve, there is no point in launching resources that may never be used. Modern CI/CD pipelines are developed around the capabilites of highly abstracted infrastrucure components. Reducing cost with agile development confilcts with optimizing cost for operated infrastructure. Dedicated resources have to be launched prior to supporting an on-demand model. With this framework, provisioning scripts for service assets ensure secure and compliant application deployments without prebuild resources. IaC libraries can be invoked to launch dedicated infrastructure together with a deployment script. 

* *Leverage network segmentation for hybrid services* Terms, like "cloud native" or "enterprise applications" describe the fact that different application designs rely on different orchestration capabilites, implemented on the resource layer. Different system requirements and communication pattern for host-, node- or container based services require a separation on network level. Rather than building hybrid clouds, the framework allows to build hybrid services that launch orchestrators in subnets of the network domain and eases the modernization of existing applications.
